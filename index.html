    <p class="bodyText">
        Welcome to The Master Nest! This is the ultimate resource for Pokémon Go nests. We offer a list of the top worldwide nests organized by Pokémon species, separated by generation; plus a GPX section where you can get a custom route for the nest you wish to play on. Hop around the pages and start hunting!
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Our home and base of operations is the CoolDown Club discord server, which you can access <a href="https://discord.gg/yaFNCak">[here]</a>. You can find organized raids, rare Pokémon spawns, mini-games and much more! Plus it is the best place to report any discrepancies you may find in this report, as we manually research and submit each nest each migration.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        And keep in mind the following list, these are <strong>the only species that nest</strong>, any other Pokémon is only obtainable through regular spawns, eggs, research or raids!

        This is <strong>migration 138b</strong>. This one was <strong>a complete overhaul</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        <strong>Major changes</strong> took place once the Season of Celebration kicked in on December 1st all over the world. The very first thing we noticed was a severely decreased pool of nesting species, going from 100 to a mere 29 (with a few new additions).
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        At first we thought this would be "fixed" with the introduction of Gen VI on December 2nd with the addition of new nesting species; however, this wasn't the case.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        <strong>Sadly, at least for now there doesn't seem to be any Kalos Pokémon currently in nests.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        They are in the wild, just not in nests. This is something that caught us off guard, with every prior new gen release featuring a frameshift migration in which the new starters and the rattata-mon were introduced into the nest pool. But not this time. #Niantic
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Instead, we got a complete rework on the nest pool. For starters (heh) Johto and Unova starters are gone, alongside a looong list of other species. <strong>Aron</strong> is back in nests (of all things) and it brought its friends <strong>Spheal, Snover and Drilbur</strong> to play. As usual, you can find a list of all nesting species right above this blog. It's a tiny list now though.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        We'll have to wait and see what Niantic decides to do with the new Seasons mechanic and how that reflects on nests. This Season is set to end on March 1st, and I just can't imagine this heavily reduced nest pool remaining until then. There's also another scheduled migration in a week, and who knows what changes that might bring (if any).
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        We'll remain vigilant to any changes, and will make sure we bring you guys the most accurate information regarding these crazy plays from Niantic. Man, I was SO ready to implement Gen 6 to the site. I weep.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        In the meantime here's our report and we hope you find it useful, good news is most species are available as shinies so there's that; if you notice any inaccuracies please report them to any member of staff over in our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/yaFNCak">[here]</a>. We're only human, mistakes are bound to happen!

        Thanks for stopping by; stay healthy, stay merry and happy hunting in these holiday times!
