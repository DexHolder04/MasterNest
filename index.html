        Welcome to The Master Nest! This is the ultimate resource for Pokémon Go nests. We offer a list of the top worldwide nests organized by Pokémon species, separated by generation; plus a GPX section where you can get a custom route for the nest you wish to play on. Hop around the pages and start hunting!

    <p class="bodyText">
        Our home and base of operations is the CoolDown Club discord server, which you can access <a href="https://discord.gg/yaFNCak">[here]</a>. You can find organized raids, rare Pokémon spawns, mini-games and much more! Plus it is the best place to report any discrepancies you may find in this report, as we manually research and submit each nest each migration.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        And keep in mind the following list, these are <strong>the only species that nest</strong>, any other Pokémon is only obtainable through regular spawns, eggs, research or raids!

        This is <strong>migration 171b</strong>. This one was <strong>an actual surprise</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Hi again! It is an unusual time for a report update, especially since we're having a migration ocurring in just about 4 days from now. But this was kinda special. 
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Gen 7 is here! And I don't mean just in the wild and raids and as part of this new Season, I mean in the <strong>nest pool</strong>. Newcomers <strong>Yungoos and Pikipek</strong> are joining the current nest pool for this Season, and from the looks of it they'll stay in it at least until the end of the season. Remember, Yungoos's shiny has already been released so it's definitely a worthy nesting species!
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The reason I was so surprised this time around is a matter of previous experience. Last time, when the Kalos region started having its initial waves of release I was all excited waiting for the starters and maybe a few extras to be dropped into the nesting pool (just like how Unova starters were). To my dismay though, not a single Gen 6 Pokémon was added to the nesting pool, and it wouldn't happen for months, and even then the starters were not included until even later on.
    </p>
    <p class ="bodyText">
        I was genuinely expecting to be disappointed once again, and was pleasantly surprised. It's not the starters, but it's a cute weasel, <strong>and</strong> it can be shiny. I'm okay with that!
    </p>
    <p class ="bodyText">
        So I updated our report, modified the site to accomodate a Gen 7 page and here it is! I know the site looks a bit rough on mobile (which accounts for about 80% of our visits) but I promise these are details that will be ironed out soon(tm).
    </p>
    <p class ="bodyText">
        The Season of Alola is still active and may have thrown us off on some nests, so as always please feel free to report any inaccuracies or new findings over our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/yaFNCak">[here]</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="bodyText">
        Thanks for stopping by; stay healthy and happy hunting!
